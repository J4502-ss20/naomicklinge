  <h2>Naomi Klinge</h2>
  <h3>Multimedia Reporter | Digital | International</h3>
  <p>As a student at the University of Missouri studying International Journalism and Political Science, I have had the chance to become an experienced reporter. I currently report for Missouri Business Alert, a statewide online publication. I have also worked as a reporter at the Columbia Missourian, a city newspaper, and as a news and digital producer at KOMU 8 News, an NBC affiliate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year I spent 7 months abroad, a huge step in my goal to one day work internationally. I first spent four months as a communications intern at International Crisis Group, a conflict resolution NGO in Brussels, which introduced me to the conflict world, something I've always been incredibly interested in. I then moved to Delhi for the summer to work as a reporting intern at the Indian Express, a prominent english-language newspaper that allowed me to begin reporting on human rights and immigration, a topic I plan to feature heavily in my work moving forward. I also produced a project about apartheid during a summer in South Africa, and I lived with a host family in the Dominican Republic during a summer in high school.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now I want to continue reporting on groups who don't always have the chance to speak for themselves and dedicate my time to understanding how cultures and communities intersect with socio-political movements.</p>

    <h3> At street art festival, participants bring varied palette of skills</h3>
    <h4> As my first pitch at Missouri Business Alert, I had no idea how to talk about business, so I went with what I know: art! I thought my editor would immediately reject the idea, but we sat and figured out how to make it relevant for the publication's target audience, showing how artists are entrepreneurs.</h4>

    <h4> I had the chance to work on several amazing stories in Delhi, but this was the first I was lead reporter on. Because of language barriers, I was mostly assisting and shadowing other journalists, but for this piece I did the research and pitched the story, so I took charge as another reporter translated for me.</h4>

    <h3> Black Theater: From repression to integration</h3>
    <h4> My first major reporting project was in Cape Town, South Africa, where I traveled with a group from my university. As someone who has been involved with theater my whole life, I decided to build on that knowledge and do a project about the history of black theater in the country.</h4>
